# Logging

We are using [log4j2](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) as our logger, and `AppLogger` is used as a wraparound of the logger to control the logging levels programmatically according to our requirements.

**Note to developers**
- The logging level can be controlled using the `loggingLevel` setting in the configuration file (See [Configuration](../docs/Configuration.md)).
- The global-logger `AppLogger` can be obtained using `LoggerManager.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to `src/main/resources/log4j2.xml`'s specified pattern


# Guidelines

## Logging Levels

- FATAL
  - Critical use case affected, which may possibly cause the termination of the application

- ERROR **(NOT USED)**

- WARN
  - Can continue, but with caution

- INFO
  - Information important for the application's purpose
    - e.g. update to local model/request sent to cloud
  - Information that the layman user can understand

- DEBUG
  - Used for superficial debugging purposes to pinpoint components that the fault/bug is likely to arise from
  - Should include more detailed information as compared to `INFO` i.e. log useful information!
    - e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

- TRACE
  - Everywhere, e.g. entry and exit of ALL methods, including the parameters being given/returned
  - Will not be using log4j2 for this, will explore AOP at a future date

## General

- Possible guidelines to adhere to:
  - Include version of code being run in EVERY file
  - Don't manually concatenate strings, which may worsen performance
    - This should apply to the code throughout, but is more significant when logging messages. If concatenation is really required, use `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer`
    - Instead, use log4j2's `{}` to log parameters
  - `Catch` blocks that re-throw the exception should not log the exception as this may lead to repeated logging of the same exception
  - Avoid `NullPointerException`s, which may occur if we try to log some return value of an object's method, when the object itself may be null
  - Ensure that the object being printed has `toString()` implemented, if not the printout will be uninformative such as `Object@31942`
