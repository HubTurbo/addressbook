# Launcher
We compiled a simple launcher to launch our main application, typically with the name `launcher-<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>.jar`. This is so that we are able to customize launch arguments for the main application.

It will also launch the update migrator before the main application if there are pending updates.
