# WHY do we have this?
This is a sample app that is used for training and experimentation of HubTurbo developers.
It tries to simulate various situations we have in HT, but at a smaller scale.

# WHAT does it do?
It is an address book application. Data are stored in an XML file.
It periodically syncs data in the primary XML file with another mirror file.
